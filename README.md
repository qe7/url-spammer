# url-spammer

obviously need Python, and PIP to install the imports if not already installed.

to run it open cmd or an IDE/TE terminal.

```
$ py app.py
```
or
```
$ python app.py
```

Input the URL and the amount you want to spam it, easy as pie. (only did this because bored, please dont execute me >w<)

Would literally only use this for "botting" profile views as an example.
